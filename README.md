# Compiler Api
## What is compiler API?
Compiler API is a generic template code for helping people using any kind of server-based compiler in need of a more compact and
automatic compilation.
## How to use it?
I am not developing any kind of frontend application for this, so the usage can be bent into your custom necessities.
Basically, it's an API with user registration and authentication and a Dockerfile with a basic server-based compiling workflow.
